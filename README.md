# Aaron’s Portfolio 🚀

Hi, I’m **Aaron** — a developer who loves turning ideas into clean, fast, human-friendly products.  
I’m most at home in **frontend** and **full-stack** work, with a growing focus on **practical AI**.

I’m always looking for new challenges and for other builders who care as much as I do — whether that’s:
- starting a study group  
- shipping a weekend project  
- or making everyday tools simpler so you have more time for what you love
